# Cub3D üëæ

The goal of ``cub3d`` is to make *something* using raycasting (like [Wolfenstein 3D](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D)).

### First of all:
  The more time I spend on the project, the much more I like it.

This project is written in ``c`` using ``mini-libx`` Library, 
This old library has a little builtin-funcs that's can make my project show on the graphics
