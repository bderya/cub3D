# Cub3D üëæ

The goal of ``cub3d`` is to make *something* using raycasting (like [Wolfenstein 3D](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D)).

### First of all:
  The more time I spend on the project, the much more I like it.

This project is written in ``c`` using ``mini-libx`` Library, 
This old library has a little builtin-funcs that's can make my project show on the graphics

## Resources

I strongly suggest everybody to read [this documentation](https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/projects/cub3d). It mentions everything we need to know.

In our project the main resource that we used to was [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYRrGTC7GtA). We tried to follow the content creator step by step especially with mathemathical formulas and calculations which we use in raycasting.
